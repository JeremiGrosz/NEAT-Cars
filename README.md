# Self driving cars using Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies

### Game environment
The environment is created using Pygame. The environment is available to try out in car_game.py. 

Wall detection is done through ray-casting, it is not optimized and therefore quite slow for more than 30 rays.



## NOTES:
#### Refactoring:
* Rewrite functions, each function should do one thing and one thing only
* Optimize ray-casting, today it is very heavy computationaly

### To Add:
* Add game-menu in order to chose free play or train the algo
* Add a sandbox mode where the terrain can be drawn.


Sidenote: port to Unity?
